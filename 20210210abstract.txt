Navajo Nation Water Quality Interactive Web Map

Manideep Potluru, Daniel Beene

Abstract - February 10, 2021

This web map leverages D3.js, dc.js, and Crossfilter.js to interpret, access, and visualize a comprehensive database of 
water quality at unregulated water sources on the Navajo Nation between the years 1933 and 2020. The Navajo Nation is 
home to multiple environmental contaminants stemming from a legacy of uranium mining and other resource extraction. This 
problem is compounded because roughly 20% of Navajo residents rely on unregulated water sources for daily consumption and 
use. The UNM METALS Superfund Research Program has compiled a water quality database using data from the Navajo EPA, USEPA, 
US Army Corps of Engineers, and the States of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. As of yet, there has not been any robust 
mechanism to disseminate and visualize this dataset. The web map platform will allow users to select contaminants of 
interest and will display graphics of data distributions and quality that are responsive to the extent of the map frame.
