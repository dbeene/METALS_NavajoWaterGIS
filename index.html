            This interactive web map gives you access to the <i>most complete</i> spatial database of unregulated water
            sources
            on and around the Navajo Nation. Each of the 4,824 water source records in this app contains data for up to
            47 water
            quality parameters, including radionuclides, metals, and other regulated contaminants. <br><br>

            We also provide data-driven recommendations for the safe use of water from these sources, indicating whether
            the water can
            be used for irrigation</b> (like watering home gardens), <b>household chores</b> (like washing laundry and
            dishes),
            <b>livestock watering</b>, or if the water should be avoided completely. <br><br>

            <b>We do not recommend drinking any water from these sources.</b> However, we recognize that each water
            source in this map is used for many daily activities.<br><br>

            Each recommendation comes with an easy-to-read metric of our confidence in it, which we base on a number of
            factors, like how many water
            samples were taken, how old those samples are, and if we had to use statistical approaches to estimate
            concentrations of contaminants in the source.<br><br>

        <p class="body-text">
            In the United States, the use of unregulated water sources – defined as sources that do not meet
            criteria to be classified as a public water system as defined by the Safe Drinking Water Act - are
            used regularly for livestock watering, agriculture, domestic, and other purposes. Nationally, more
            than 45 million people rely on unregulated water sources for drinking water; however, there remains
            infrastructure disparities for drinking water access in communities on Tribal nations. For the
            Navajo Nation, a sovereign Indigenous nation in the Southwestern United States, between 7% and 30%
            of homes lack plumbing to deliver household drinking water, so residents are compelled to access
            other water sources – regulated and unregulated alike. Previous unregulated water quality studies on
            the Navajo Nation were regionally focused and unsuitable for evaluating water quality trends across
            the Navajo Nation, an area that encompasses more than 71,000 square kilometers in Arizona, New

                Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) Portal</a>. The first table is derived from the Navajo Nation Wells
            Database, consisting of more than 5,000 groundwater well records. The second
            table includes water quality data from 18
            distinct studies collected between 1905 and 2020. The data table includes
            845 analytes with the largest number of
            observations for trace metals, metalloids, radionuclides, and water
            chemistry parameters. The data presented here
            represent the publicly available portion of the data compilation. <u>This
                tool should not be interpreted as a definitive or
                complete record of all wells and water quality results in the
                region.</u> In total, the dataset presented here visualized
            results for 4,824 water sources.<br>

            <br>Some studies recorded uranium concentrations in units of activity
            (picocuries per liter), which were converted to mass
            per unit volume (&mu;g/L) by dividing activity by 0.67. If multiple
            measurements were available per analyte per well, the
            maximum concentration was determined for radionuclides, metals, and
            metalloids, and the median concentration was
            calculated for pH, conductivity, hardness, and other measures of water
            chemistry. Measurements that are below the
            instrument limit of detection are recorded in the dataset. Values are
            imputed as the LOD for visualization purposes. The
            downloadable dataset records the LOD and may be used with various imputation
            methods for more rigorous statistical
            analysis.

                    Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element found in deposits across the earth's crust. Today, enriched uranium is mainly used as fuel for nuclear 
                    power generation. It is distributed throughout the environment primarily through wind and water movement. It can be taken up into plants through root systems. 
                    Abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) across the Navajo Nation may be inadequately reclaimed, increasing the likelihood of uranium mobility through the environment. 
                    Drinking water is the primary source of uranium exposure. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) 
                    <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp150.pdf" target="_blank"> toxicological profile</a>, uranium exhibits significant adverse effects on kidneys. 
                    Animal studies show uranium residence in other organs, such as brain tissue. Some uranium compounds may cause skin irritation.<br><br>

        <h3>The Recommendation Model:</h3>
        <p class="body-text">
            For each of the ten chemicals we define degrees of safe concentrations based on the guidelines and regulations
            discussed above. Then, we utilized a machine learning model, adaptive fuzzy neural inference system (ANFIS), to
            define and parameterize more than 1.3 million rules based on every possible combination of high, medium
            high, medium low, and low concentrations of each chemical in each water source.
        </p>
        <h4 id="section-household">Household use:</h4>
        <p class="body-text">
            Household water uses may typically include cleaning (such as dishes or laundry)
            or sanitation, but not any
            human consumption. As such, concentrations of regulated contaminants may be higher than maximum
            concentration levels (MCLs) defined by either the Navajo EPA or USEPA. Because dermal exposure to
            potentially contaminated waters is possible with household use, we rely on the EPA recreational/camper
            regional screening levels (RSL) to make our recommendations. 
            <br>
        </p>
        <h4 id="section-irrigation">Irrigation:</h4>
        <p class="body-text">
            Hauled water may be used to irrigate small gardens or other food sources for consumption. Our recommendations
            for irrigaiton water are based on the Navajo Nation agricultural water supply limits, which you can see 
            <a href="https://www.epa.gov/wqs-tech/water-quality-standards-regulations-navajo-nation" target="_blank">here</a>.
            <br>
        </p>
        <h4 id="section-livestock">Livestock watering:</h4>
        <p class="body-text">
            Many of the water sources included in this resource are livestock wells, though without complete records we can't
            adequately detetrmine the exact number of livestoc-specific wells, nor can we be sure that multi-purpose wells aren't
            also used for livestock water. We base our recommendations for livestock watering on the Navajo Nation livestock
            watering guidlines, which you can see <a href="https://www.epa.gov/wqs-tech/water-quality-standards-regulations-navajo-nation" target="_blank">here</a>.
            <br>
        </p>
        <h4 id="section-avoid">Avoid:</h4>
        <p class="body-text">
            We recommend avoiding any water sources with concentrations of Al, As, Ba, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Se, and U higher than those defined in the guidelines discussed above. 
            Furthermore, we individually assessed water sources with measurements of radioactive elements like
            Radium-226 and 228 or gross alpha particles and excluded any sources with at least one measurement higher
            than federally stipulated limits (e.g., total radium greater than 5pCi/L).

        </p>
        <h2 id="section-confidence">Confidence</h2>
        <p class="body-text">
            In instances where no laboratory-based measurements of these chemicals are available, we interpolated their
            levels using spatial co-kriging between known water samples, depth-to-water measurements, and soil/sediment
            samples. We define our level of confidence in our recommendations according to three parameters: the
            accuracy of our estimates if we made one, the number of laboratory samples collected, and how recently
            samples were collected. When we estimated concentrations of chemicals in water, we also calculated the
            standard errors of our estimates. Laboratory-based observations have an estimation standard error of 0 –
            otherwise the higher the error the lower our confidence. Similarly, if only one laboratory sample for a
            given chemical in a water source exists, we are less confident that it accurately represents water quality
            in that source than if there are multiple samples collected and analyzed. Finally, because both water
            quality and laboratory methods change over time, we are less confident in samples collected and analyzed
            from more than ten years ago. Simply put, our confidence is highest for sources where multiple samples were
            collected within the last decade, and our confidence erodes when we have less observational data.
