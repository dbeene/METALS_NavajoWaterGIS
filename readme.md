# Navajo Nation Water Quality Interactive Map

# About this Project:
In the United States the use of unregulated water sources – defined as sources that do not meet criteria to be classified as a public water system as defined by the Safe Drinking Water Act - are used regularly for livestock watering, agriculture, domestic, and other purposes. Nationally, more than 45 million people rely on unregulated water sources for drinking water; however, there remains infrastructure disparities for drinking water access in communities on Tribal nations. For the Navajo Nation, a sovereign Indigenous nation in the Southwestern United States, between 7% and 30% of homes lack plumbing to deliver household drinking water, so residents are compelled to access other water sources – regulated and unregulated alike. Previous unregulated water quality studies on the Navajo Nation were regionally focused and unsuitable for evaluating water quality trends across the Navajo Nation, an area that encompasses more than 71,000 square kilometers in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Therefore, beginning in 2011 the Community Environmental Health Program at the University of New Mexico began to compile existing water quality datasets, principally for unregulated groundwater sources, in a single geospatial relational database.

Researchers at the University of New Mexico Center for Native Environmental Health Equity Research of the New Mexico METALS Superfund Research Program, University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, and the Southwest Research and Information Center have compiled a database of water quality measurements from groundwater wells on the Navajo Nation using data from the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency, and data from researchers at the University of New Mexico, Diné College and Northern Arizona University. To date, this data compilation has been used for publications but has not been disseminated publicly. The purpose of this website is to facilitate access to these compiled water quality data. The application design enables users to view water quality information using statistical and geospatial tools. Our hope is that this information will support individual and community decisions about water use from unregulated sources.

# About this Dataset:
The compiled dataset consists of two primary data tables. The first table is derived from the Navajo Nation Wells Database, consisting of more than 5,000 groundwater well records. The second table includes water quality data from 18 distinct studies collected between 1905 and 2020. The data table includes 845 analytes with the largest number of observations for trace metals, metalloids, radionuclides, and water chemistry parameters. The data presented here represent the publicly available portion of the data compilation. This tool should not be interpreted as a definitive or complete record of all wells and water quality results in the region. In total, the dataset presented here visualized results for 1,101 water sources.

Some studies recorded uranium concentrations in units of activity (picocuries per liter), which were converted to mass per unit volume (μg/L) by dividing activity by 0.67. If multiple measurements were available per analyte per well, the maximum concentration was determined for radionuclides, metals, and metalloids, and the median concentration was calculated for pH, conductivity, hardness, and other measures of water chemistry. Measurements that are below the instrument limit of detection are recorded in the dataset. Values are imputed as the LOD for visualization purposes. The downloadable dataset records the LOD and may be used with various imputation methods for more rigorous statistical analysis.
