# Navajo Nation Water Quality Interactive Map

# Dr. Yang comments and suggestions

* 3/1/2021 (Minor suggestions for your alpha submission)
  * It is nice you have the scroll function implemented for the popup, to make it more readable, I would suggestion the following: (1) add a blank line between "WELL INFORMATION- NAVAJO NATION WELL" and the first popup item (i.e., FID), (2) bold the header name (e.g., "FID:", "well_no:") for each popup item, and add a space after the ":", and remove the ";" at the end, (e.g., "FID:743;" to  "**FID:** 743"). Also, I would suggest you  remove the "OBJECTID:", as I do not think they give useful info.
  * Nice looking About modal, well done. One minor suggestion here, change "About this Website:" to "ABout This Project:" or "About this Web Map App", as it is not simple a website, it is an interactive web app.
